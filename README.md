This repository contains shared notes and documents related to the work of the Pedagogy Interest Group. Meeting notes and agendas can be viewed in this [shared Google document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G0F7qbZ-6vkUfKNE91yQ97zYYfqUqHvKtfdnNU5Qzw4/edit?usp=sharing).

The aim of the Interest Group is to support educators who want to incorporate music encoding and related practices into educational and cultural heritage institutions within the frames established by their accrediting bodies and other governing agencies. We are interested in developing documentation with learning goals and outcomes appropriate for different levels and types of classes; identifying tools that enable such classes to support varying levels of digital literacy and computational competency generating modules with easy on ramps adaptable to many kinds of pedagogies, including assessment models; sharing expertise, particularly in pedagogical contexts; diversifying the repertoire used in instruction; and extending the digital community to include institutions and individuals who may otherwise lack support for making and teaching digital knowledge.

The Group will meet regularly during the MEC and through electronic means to identify specific projects that will advance the goals noted above, both in the short and long term, according to the needs and capacities of our members. The group will keep an archive of discussions that anyone may review. The group welcomes any member of the MEI community interested to get involved by subscribing to the mailing list https://lists.uni-paderborn.de/mailman/listinfo/mei-pedagogy-ig or the MEI Slack channel [join the MEI Slack here](https://join.slack.com/t/music-encoding/shared_invite/zt-4zgx6zbq-2jEjDiUT7ym3dygTaY8C0g).
